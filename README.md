## Description
This repository contains the Python version of **Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG)**,
a tool for automatically generating chemical reaction
mechanisms for modeling reaction systems including pyrolysis, combustion,
atmospheric science, and more.

It also includes **CanTherm**, the package for calculating thermodynamics, high-pressure-limit
rate coefficients, and pressure dependent rate coefficients from quantum chemical calculations.
CanTherm is compatible with a variety of ab initio quantum chemistry software programs, including but not limited to
Gaussian, MOPAC, QChem, and MOLPRO.
