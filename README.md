## Description
This repository contains the Python version of **Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG)**,
a tool for automatically generating chemical reaction
mechanisms for modeling reaction systems including pyrolysis, combustion,
atmospheric science, and more.

It also includes **CanTherm**, the package for calculating thermodynamics, high-pressure-limit
rate coefficients, and pressure dependent rate coefficients from quantum chemical calculations.
CanTherm is compatible with a variety of ab initio quantum chemistry software programs, including but not limited to
Gaussian, MOPAC, QChem, and MOLPRO.

*This branch is for the heterogeneous catalysis version!* (be sure to use the corresponding branch in the RMG-database)

## Source Code Repository
- [RMG Github Repository](https://github.com/ReactionMechanismGenerator/RMG-Py): contains the latest source code for RMG
- [RMG-database Github Repository](https://github.com/ReactionMechanismGenerator/RMG-database): contains source code for the latest version of the database

## How to Install
You can either download the source from GitHub and compile yourself, or download the binaries from Anaconda.
Please see the [Download and Install](http://reactionmechanismgenerator.github.io/RMG-Py/users/rmg/installation/index.html) page for detailed instructions.
