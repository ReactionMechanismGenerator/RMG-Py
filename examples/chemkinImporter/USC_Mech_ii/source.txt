Abstract
========

This  H2/CO/C1-C4 kinetic model (111 species and 784 reactions), applicable to a wide variety 
of combustion scenarios, incorporates the recent thermodynamic, kinetic, and species transport 
updates relevant to high-temperature oxidation of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and C1-C4 hydrocarbons. 
This model was developed on the basis of

 * an optimized reaction model of H2/CO combustion
 * GRI-Mech1.2 and 3.0
 * a comprehensive reaction model of ethylene and acetylene combustion
 * reaction mechanism of C3 fuel combustion
 * 1,3-Butadiene oxidation at high temperatures.

Also, the rate parameters of CO+OH, OH+HO2 and CO+HO2 were updated from more recent studies. 
Rate parameters of several C1 and C2 reactions were reevaluated.  The oxidation model of benzene 
and toluene is included.  

The reaction model was subject to validation tests against reliable H2/CO/C1-C4 combustion data.
