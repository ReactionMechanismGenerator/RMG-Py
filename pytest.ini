# --disable-warnings to ignore the enormous number of warnings completely
# --last-failed to run only the tests which failed on the previous run
# --show-capture no/stdout/stderr/both
# -k "test name" will run only the tests that match the pattern in quotes, i.e. "test_arkane or test_rmg" would run those two tests
# -n auto # will use all available cores, if you first pip install pytest-xdist, but it doesn't work well with julia (so add --no-julia? or give up?)
