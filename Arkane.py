This is the main executable script for Arkane, a tool for computing chemical
reaction rates and other properties used in detailed kinetics models using
various methodologies and theories. To run Arkane, use the command ::

    $ python Arkane.py FILE

where ``FILE`` is the path to an Arkane input file describing the job to
execute. Arkane will run the specified job, writing the output to
``output.py`` and a log to both the console and to ``Arkane.log``, with both
files appearing in the same directory as the input file. Some additional
command-line arguments are available; run the command ::

    $ python Arkane.py -h

for more information.
