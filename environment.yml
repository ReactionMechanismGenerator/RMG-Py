# environment.yml - conda environment specification file for RMG-Py
#
# Usage: conda env create --file environment.yml
#
# This file contains all of the software packages needed to run RMG-Py.
# There is a mixture of the following
# - packlages would could be installed at OS level, but we install here
#   for better version control
# - python tools
# - external software tools specific to chemistry
# - other software we maintain which RMG depends on
# + some other categories (see below)
#
# Changelog:
# - May 15, 2023 Added this changelog, added inline documentation,
#   made dependency list more explicit (@JacksonBurns).

  # we use a the pytest-check plugin, which is on Conda and PyPI, but the

# packages we maintain
  - rmg::gprof2dot
  - rmg::lpsolve55
  - rmg::muq2
  - rmg::numdifftools
  - rmg::pydas >=1.0.3
  - rmg::pydqed >=1.0.3
  - rmg::pyrdl
  - rmg::pyrms
  - rmg::quantities
  - rmg::symmetry

# packages we would like to stop maintaining (and why)
  - rmg::diffeqpy
  # we should use the official verison https://github.com/SciML/diffeqpy),
  # rather than ours (which is only made so that we can get it from conda)
  # It is only on pip, so we will need to do something like:
  # https://stackoverflow.com/a/35245610

  - rmg::chemprop
  # Our build of this is version 0.0.1 (!!) and we are using parts
  # of the API that are now gone. Need a serious PR to fix this.

  - rmg::rdkit >=2020.03.3.0
  # We should use the official channel, not sure how difficult this
  # change will be.

# conda mutex metapackage
  - nomkl

# additional packages that are required, but not specified here (and why)
  # pydqed, pydas, mopac, and likely others require a fortran compiler (specifically gfortran)
  # in the environment. Normally we would add this to the environment file with
  # - libgfortran-ng >= 10
  # but this exact package is only maintained for Linux, meaning that if we were to add
  # it here the environment creation would fail on Mac. The way it ends up working behind
  # the scenes is that conda will find a different package for Mac that provides gfortran,
  # but because we cannot specify per-platform requirements in this file we simply leave
  # it out.
