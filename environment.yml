# environment.yml - conda environment specification file for RMG-Py
#
# Usage: conda env create --file environment.yml
#
# This file contains all of the software packages needed to run RMG-Py.
# There is a mixture of the following
# - packlages would could be installed at OS level, but we install here
#   for better version control
# - python tools
# - external software tools specific to chemistry
# - other software we maintain which RMG depends on
# + some other categories (see below)
#
# Changelog:
# - May 15, 2023 Added this changelog, added inline documentation,
#   made dependency list more explicit (@JacksonBurns).
# - October 16, 2023 Switched RDKit and descripatastorus to conda-forge,
#   moved diffeqpy to pip and (temporarily) removed chemprop
# - April 17, 2024 Limit versions of cclib at advice of maintainers.
# - August 4, 2024 Restricted pyrms to <2
# - May 14, 2024 Removed diffeqpy by switching to call SciMLBase and Sundials using JuliaCall
# - March 15, 2024 - started migration to Python 3.9

# configure packages to use OpenBLAS instead of Intel MKL
  - blas=*=openblas

# Cantera 2.6 on the Cantera channel is configured to use Intel MKL. It doesn't specify a version minimum
# but crashes if MKL is too old, so we have to enforce a minimum version here. But, if we can switch over
# to the conda-forge version, we should be able to remove this line (and maybe the two after it)
# because it use OpenBLAS instead. 
  - conda-forge::mkl >=2023.1.0
  # 2023.1.0 is just a guess at the minimum version. Older versions might work too.
  - conda-forge::libcurl <= 8.9 
  # There's a Julia/PyCall installation bug associated with libcurl 8.10+:
  # https://discourse.julialang.org/t/curl-multi-assign-and-segmentation-fault-when-installing-package/120901/3
  - conda-forge::pyopenssl >20
  # ThermoCentralDatabaseInterface fails if pyopenssl is too old. 20 is just a guess at the version number. 

# additional packages that are required, but not specified here (and why)
  # pydqed, pydas, mopac, and likely others require a fortran compiler (specifically gfortran)
  # in the environment. Normally we would add this to the environment file with
  # - libgfortran-ng >= 10
  # but this exact package is only maintained for Linux, meaning that if we were to add
  # it here the environment creation would fail on Mac. The way it ends up working behind
  # the scenes is that conda will find a different package for Mac that provides gfortran,
  # but because we cannot specify per-platform requirements in this file we simply leave
  # it out.
