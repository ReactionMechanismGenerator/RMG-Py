This folder ('external') is for external programs that RMG depends on but are 
not part of the RMG code itself. In most cases you can get them elsewhere. 
Nevertheless, they are stored here because
 (1) they may be hard to find elsewhere
 (2) we know that that these versions work (but ones from elsewhere may not)

ctml_writer.py 
comes from Cantera 1.7 (https://sourceforge.net/projects/cantera/)
which we think uses the New BSD License

pydot.py 
comes from Pydot (http://www.dkbza.org/pydot.html)
which uses the MIT license
http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html
the version here is based on 1.0.2 but contains a bug fix patch


cinfony/webel.py

jquery.min.js
from http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.1/jquery.min.js
Used by the HTML output of RMG. Useful to have it locally if you do not have
internet access when you want to look at your results.

the results of computational chemistry packages.

This is based on version 1.0 but with some modifications,
probably made in the RMG-Java project.
We should endeavor to get the modifications merged upstream and use the main cclib.
