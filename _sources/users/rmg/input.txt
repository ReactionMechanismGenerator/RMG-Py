Syntax
======

The format of RMG-Py input files is based on Python syntax. 

Each section is made up of one or more function calls, where parameters are 
specified as text strings, numbers, or objects. Text strings must be wrapped in
either single or double quotes.

Datasources
===========

.. _thermolibraries:

Thermo Libraries
---------------

By default, RMG will calculate the thermodynamic properties of the species from
Benson additivity formulas. In general, the group-additivity results are
suitably accurate. However, if you would like to override the default settings,
you may specify the thermodynamic properties of species in the
ThermoLibrary. When a species is specified in the ThermoLibrary,
RMG will automatically use those thermodynamic properties instead of generating
them from Benson's formulas. Multiple libraries may be created, if so desired.
The order in which the thermo libraries are specified is important: 
If a species appears in multiple thermo libraries, the first instance will
be used.

Please see Section :ref:`editingthermodatabase` for details on editing the
thermo library. In general, it is best to leave the ThermoLibrary
set to its default value.  In particular, the thermodynamic properties for H and H2
must be specified in one of the primary thermo libraries as they cannot be estimated
by Benson's method

In addition to the default library, RMG comes with the thermodynamic properties
of the species in the GRI-Mech 3.0 mechanism [GRIMech3.0]_.

This library is located in the 
:file:`$RMG/RMG-database/input/thermo/libraries` directory.  All "Locations" for the
ThermoLibrary field must be with respect to the :file:`$RMG/RMG-database/input/thermo/libraries`
directory.::

.. _reactionlibraries:

Reaction Libraries
-----------------
The next section of the :file:`input.py` file specifies which, if any,
Reaction Libraries should be used. When a reaction library is specified, RMG will first
use the reaction library to generate all the relevant reactions for the species 
in the core before going through the reaction templates.Unlike the Seed Mechanism, 
reactions present in a Reaction Library will not be included in the core automatically 
from the start.  

You can specify your own reaction library in the location section. 
In the following example, the user has created 
a reaction library with a few additional reactions specific to n-butane, and these reactions 
are to be used in addition to the Glarborg C3 library::

	ReactionLibrary:
	Name: nbutane 
	Location: nbutane 
	Name: Glarborg 
	Location: Glarborg/C3
	END 	

The reaction libraries are stored in :file:`RMG-database/input/kinetics/libraries/`
and the `Location:` should be specified relative to this path.

Please note that the keyword ``END`` must be placed at the end of the Reaction Library
section. Because the units for the Arrhenius parameters are
given in each mechanism, the different mechanisms can have different units.

.. note::
	While using a Reaction Library the user must be careful enough to provide 
	all instances of a particular reaction in the library file, as RMG will 
	ignore all reactions generated by its templates.  For example, suppose you supply the
	Reaction Library with butyl_1 --> butyl_2.  Although RMG would find two unique
	instances of this reaction (via a three- and four-member cyclic Transition State),
	RMG would only use the rate coefficient supplied by you in generating the mechanism.

	RMG will not handle irreversible reactions correctly, if supplied in a Reaction
	Library, see :ref:`irreversiblekinetics`.
	

.. _seedmechanism:

Seed Mechanisms
--------------
The next section of the :file:`condition.txt` file specifies which, if any, 
Seed Mechanisms should be used.  If a seed mechanism is passed to RMG, every
species and reaction present in the mechanism will be placed into the core, in
addition to the species that are listed in the :ref:`reactants` section.

For details of the kinetics libraries included with RMG that can be used as a seed mechanism,
see :ref:`reactionlibraries`.

You can specify your own
seed mechanism in the location section. Please note that the oxidation
library should not be used for pyrolysis models. The syntax for the seed mechanisms
is similar to that of the primary reaction libraries, except for the ``GenerateReactions`` 
line, explained below.::

	SeedMechanism:
	Name: GRI-Mech 3.0
	Location: GRI-Mech3.0
	GenerateReactions: yes
	Name: Leeds 
	Location: combustion_core/version5 
	GenerateReactions: yes
	END 

The seed mechanisms are stored in :file:`$RMG/databases/RMG_database/kinetics_libraries/`
and the `Location:` should be specified relative to this path.

There is a new required ``GenerateReactions`` line in seed mechanisms that controls how RMG adds the
seed species and reactions to the model core. If set to ``yes``, RMG will use its
reaction families to react all seed species with one another; the generated
reactions will supplement the seed reactions. If set to ``no``, RMG will not
generate reactions of the seed species. In either case, RMG will react the
species in the condition file with one another and with all species in the
seed mechanism.

As the units for the Arrhenius parameters are given in each mechanism, 
different mechanisms can have different units. Additionally, if the same 
reaction occurs more than once in the combined mechanism, 
the instance of it from the first mechanism in which it appears is
the one that gets used.

Kinetics Depositories
--------------------

Kinetics Families
----------------

Kinetics Estimator
-----------------


The following is an example of a database block, based on above chosen libraries and options::

	database(
		thermoLibraries = ['primaryThermoLibrary', 'GRI-Mech3.0'],
		reactionLibraries = [],
		seedMechanisms = [],
		kineticsDepositories = ['training'], #  'all', 'default'==['training'], [], 
		kineticsFamilies = ['!Intra_Disproportionation'],
		kineticsEstimator = 'rate rules',
	)

Species
=======

Species to be included in the core at the start of your RMG job are defined in the species block. 
The label, reactive or inert, and structure of each reactant must be specified.
The label field will be used throughout your mechanism to identify the species. Inert
species in the model cab be defined by setting reactive to be ``False``, for all
other species the reactive status must be set as ``True``. The structure of the 
species can be defined using either by using SMILES or adjacencyList.  

The following is an example of a typical species item, based on methane using SMILE or adjacency list to define the structure::

	species(
		label='CH4',
		reactive=True,
		structure=SMILES("C"),
	)
	
	species(
		label='CH4',
		reactive=True,
		structure=adjacencyList(
			"""
			1 C 0
			"""
	)

Reaction System
===============

Every reaction system we want the model to be generated at must be defined individually.
Currently, RMG can only model constant temperature and pressure systems. Future versions 
will allow for variable temperature and pressure. To define a reaction system we need to 
define the temperature, pressure and initial mole fractions of the reactant species. The
initial mole fractions are defined using the label for the species in
the species block. Every reaction system can have its termination criterion based on
species conversion or termination time or both. When both termination criterion are specified
the model generation will stop when either of the termination criterion is satisfied.

The following is an example of a simple reactor system::

	simpleReactor(
		temperature=(1350,'K'),
		pressure=(1.0,'bar'),
		initialMoleFractions={
			"CH4": 0.104,
			"H2": 0.0156,
			"N2": 0.8797,
		},
		terminationConversion={
			'CH4': 0.9,
		},
		terminationTime=(1e0,'s'),
	)

On the fly Quantum Calculations
===============================

Pressure Dependence
===================

This block is used when the model should account for pressure 
dependent rate coefficients. RMG can estimate pressure dependence kinetics based on : ``Modified Strong Collision`` and ``Reservoir State``. 
The former utilizes the modified strong collision approach of Chang, Bozzelli, and Dean [Chang2000]_, 
and works reasonably well while running more rapidly. The latter 
utilizes the steady-state/reservoir-state approach of Green and Bhatti [Green2007]_, 
and is more theoretically sound but more expensive.

The pressure dependence block should specify the following ::

Method used for estimating pressure dependent kinetics
------------------------------------------------------

To specify the modified strong collision approach, this item should read ::
 
	method='Modified Strong Collision'

To specify the reservoir state approach, this item should read ::
 
	method='Reservoir State'

For more information on the two methods, consult the following resources :

.. [Chang2000] A.Y. Chang, J.W. Bozzelli, and A. M. Dean. "Kinetic Analysis of Complex Chemical Activation and Unimolecular Dissociation Reactions using QRRK Theory and the Modified Strong Collision Approximation." *Z. Phys. Chem.* **214** (11), p. 1533-1568 (2000).
.. [Green2007] N.J.B. Green and Z.A. Bhatti. "Steady-State Master Equation Methods." *Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.* **9**, p. 4275-4290 (2007).

Grain size and minimum number of grains
---------------------------------------

Since the :math:`k(E)` requires discretization in the energy space, we need to specify the number of energy grains to use
when solving the Master Equation. The default value for the minimum number of grains is 250; this was selected to balance the speed
and accuracy of the Master Equation solver method.  However, for some pressure-dependent networks,
this number of energy grains will result in the pressure-dependent :math:`k(T, P)` being greater than
the high-P limit ::

	maximumGrainSize=(0.5,'kcal/mol')
	minimumNumberOfGrains=250

Temperature and pressure for the interpolation scheme
-----------------------------------------------------

To generate the :math:`k(T,P)` interpolation model, a set of temperatures and pressures must be used. RMG can do this automatically, but it must be told a few parameters.
We need to specify the limits of the temperature and pressure for the fitting of the interpolation scheme and the number of points to be considered in between this limit.
For typical combustion model temperatures of the experiments range from 300 - 2000 K and pressure 1E-2 to 100 bar  :: 

	temperatures=(300,2000,'K',8)
	pressures=(0.01,100,'bar',5)
    
Interpolation scheme
--------------------

To disregard all temperature and pressure dependence and simply output the rate at the provided
temperature and pressure, use the line ::

	interpolation=False

To use logarithmic interpolation of pressure and Arrhenius interpolation for temperature, use the
line ::

	interpolation=('PDepArrhenius')
	
The auxillary information printed to the Chemkin chem.inp file will have the "PLOG"
format.  Refer to Section 3.5.3 of the :file:`CHEMKIN_Input.pdf` document and/or 
Section 3.6.3 of the :file:`CHEMKIN_Theory.pdf` document.  These files are part of
the CHEMKIN manual.  

To fit a set of Chebyshev polynomials on inverse temperature and logarithmic pressure axes mapped 
to [-1,1], use the line ::

	interpolation=('Chebyshev', 6, 4)
	
You should also specify the number of temperature and pressure basis functions by adding the appropriate integers. 
For example, the following specifies that six basis functions in temperature and four in pressure should be used ::

	interpolation=('Chebyshev', 6, 4)

The auxillary information printed to the Chemkin chem.inp file will have the "CHEB"
format.  Refer to Section 3.5.3 of the :file:`CHEMKIN_Input.pdf` document and/or 
Section 3.6.4 of the :file:`CHEMKIN_Theory.pdf` document.

Maximum size of adduct for which pressure dependence kinetics be generated
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default pressure dependence is run for every system that might show pressure
dependence, i.e. every isomerization, dissociation, and association reaction.
In reality, larger molecules are less likely to exhibit pressure-dependent
behavior than smaller molecules due to the presence of more modes for 
randomization of the internal energy. In certain cases involving very large
molecules, it makes sense to only consider pressure dependence for molecules
smaller than some user-defined number of atoms. This is specified e.g. using
the line ::

    maximumAtoms=16

to turn off pressure dependence for all molecules larger than the given number
of atoms (16 in the above example).


The following is an example of pressure dependence options ::

	pressureDependence(
		method='modified strong collision',
		maximumGrainSize=(0.5,'kcal/mol'),
		minimumNumberOfGrains=250,
		temperatures=(300,2000,'K',8),
		pressures=(0.01,100,'bar',5),
		interpolation=('Chebyshev', 6, 4),
		maximumAtoms=16,
	)

Miscellaneous Options
===================== 

Miscellaneous options:: 

	options(
		units='si',
		saveRestartPeriod=(1,'hour'),
		drawMolecules=False,
		generatePlots=False,
	)

Perhaps the best way to learn the input file syntax is by example. To that end,
a number of example input files and their corresponding output have been given
in the ``examples`` directory.
