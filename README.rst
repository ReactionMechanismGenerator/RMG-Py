******************************************************

This repository contains the Python version of Reaction Mechanism Generator 
(RMG), a tool for automatically generating kinetic models of chemical reaction
mechanisms, and related projects. RMG is developed primarily by researchers in 
`Prof. Green's research group <http://web.mit.edu/greengp/>`_ at the 
`Massachusetts Institute of Technology <http://web.mit.edu/>`_ 
and `Prof. West's research group <http://www.northeastern.edu/comocheng/>`_ at 
`Northeastern University <http://www.northeastern.edu/>`_ 

There are some instructions at  http://greengroup.github.com/RMG-Py/ including
details on `how to install RMG-Py
<http://greengroup.github.com/RMG-Py/users/rmg/installation/index.html>`_
and its numerous dependencies.

Details of the (earlier established) Java version of RMG can be found
on `Sourceforge <http://rmg.sourceforge.net/>`_ (although it too is 
developed `here on github <https://github.com/GreenGroup/RMG-Java/>`_.
