#   This is a configuration file for RMG-Py. 
#
#   A copy of this file is always available from site-packages/rmgpy/rmgrc. 
#   Note that any changes made to that file will likely be overridden when 
#   installing an updated version of RMG-Py. If you want to keep a permanent 
#   local copy that will not be over-written, place it in $HOME/.rmg/rmgrc 
#   (Unix-based systems) or C:\Documents and Settings\yourname\.rmg\rmgrc 
#   (Windows systems).
#
#   This file is best viewed in a editor which supports python mode
#   syntax highlighting. Blank lines, or lines starting with a comment
#   symbol (#), are ignored, as are trailing comments.  Other lines must
#   have the format
#
#       key : val # optional comment
#
#   The whitespace before and after the colon is optional.
