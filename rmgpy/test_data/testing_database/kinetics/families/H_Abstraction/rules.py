The geometries of all reactants, products, and the transition state were optimized using the CBS-QB3 calculations.  The zero-point
energy is that computed by the CBS-QB3 calculations.  The frequencies were computed with B3LYP/CBSB7.
In computing k(T), an asymmetric tunneling correction was employed, the calculated frequencies were scaled by 0.99, and the 
temperatures used were: 300, 331, 370, 419, 482, 568, 692, 885, 1227, 2000 (evenly spaced on inverse temperature scale).

If a biradical CH2JJ can abstract from RCH4 to make RCH3J and CH3J 
then a Y_rad CH3J should be able to abstract from RCH3J which means X_H needs 
to include Xrad_H. I.e. you can abstract from a radical. To make this possible
a head node has been created X_H_or_Xrad_H which is a union of X_H and Xrad_H.
The kinetics for it have just been copied from X_H and are only defined for 
abstraction by Y_rad_birad. I.e. the top level very approximate guess.

Do better kinetics for this exist? Do we in fact use the reverse kinetics anyway?

Verified by MRH on 6Aug2009

Entry 46,5(f): No measurements on H-atom abstraction rxns. Recommended rate coefficient

is computed as follows:

The rate of O + C3H6 --> OH + H2C=CH-*CH2 is computed using the expression:
[k(O+C2H6-->C2H5+HO)/k(OH+C2H6-->C2H5+H2O)] * k(OH+C3H6-->H2C=CH-*CH2+H2O).
The author uses this expression because he notes that OH and O H-atom abstraction
rxns generally follow the same trend.  The O+C2H6, OH+C2H6, and OH+C3H6
are from other Tsang review articles.
The rate of O+C3H6 --> OH+CH3C=CH2 is computed by adjusting the O+C3H6 --> OH+H2C=CH-*CH2
rate coefficient: increasing the Ea/R by 880 Kelvin and multiplying the A
by ~0.345; these values come from the relative difference between the rxns

CH2O + H2C=C[*CH2][CH3] = HCO + H2C=C[CH3]2

Geometries and energies of reactants, products, and TS were computed using the CBS-QB3 methodology; frequencies
were calculated at B3LYP/CBSB7.  Arrhenius expression was computed using CanTherm; an asymmetric Eckart tunneling
correction was employed and the frequencies were scaled by 0.99 (as suggested by Montgomergy et al.; J. Chem. Phys.
110 (1999) 2822-2827).  The Arrhenius fit was based on k(T) at T=600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800, and 2000K.
The external symmetry number for CH2O and iso-butene was 2; the external symmetry for all others was 1.  The
electronic spin multiplicity was 1 for CH2O and iso-butene; the electronic spin multiplicity for all others was 2.
The computed pre-exponential factor was divided by 2 (symmetry of CH2O), from 6.13e-02 to 3.065e-02.

There are no rate coefficients for this reaction in the literature (based on MRH's limited search).
   Tsang {J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 20 (1991) 221-273} recommends the following for the reaction of 
   CH2O + H2C=CH-*CH2 = HCO + H2C=CH-CH3: k(T) = 1.26e+08 * T^1.9 * exp(-18.184 kcal/mol / RT) cm3 mol-1 s-1.
   This rate coefficient is 25-85x faster than MRH's calculation over the range 600-2000K.
   
   The previous estimate by RMG for this reaction was: k(T) = 5.500e+03 * T^2.81 * exp(-5.86 kcal/mol / RT) cm3 mol-1 s-1.
   This rate coefficient is 80-13,000x faster than MRH's calculation over the range 600-2000K.

It was measured at pretty low temperatures (294-376), but also calculated ab initio. The calculated
rates are plotted but the expression is not reported.

    k = (10.0 +- 2.1)E-11 exp[-(4.4+-0.5 kJ mol)/RT] cm3 molecule-1 s-1
which gives 
    A = 6e13+-1.3e13 cm3/mole/s
    n = 0
    Ea = 1.05+-0.12  kcal/mol
The degeneracy of this reaction is 8 though, so per-site A is:
    A = 7.5e12+-1.6e12
    
(See also  doi:10.1063/1.3480395  for reactions of C2, but that may be the wrong electronic state.)

MRH CBS-QB3 calculations w/1d hindered rotor corrections
Exact reaction: CH3CH2CH=CH2 + OOCH3 = HOOCH3 + CH3CHCH=CH2

This reaction was of interest to MRH/MHS because the butanol model was sensitive to its kinetics
(in particular, the C4H8-1 predicted concentration for 10-atm JSR simulations between 800-1000 K).
The original mechanism had an estimate that was much faster than these new calculations (the RMG old
k(T) was 50-100x faster than these calculations between 800-1000 K).

MRH computed these kinetics using the CBS-QB3 method.  Hindered rotor corrections were accounted for in all species:
	CH3CH2CH=CH2: -CH3 and -CH2CH3 rotor
	OOCH3: -CH3 rotor
	TS: -CH3 and -CH=CH2 rotor of react1, -CH3 and -OCH3 of react2, and -OOCH3 between react1 and react2
	HOOCH3: -CH3 and -OCH3 rotor
	CH3CHCH=CH2: -CH3 and -CH=CH2 rotor
External symmetry number of all speces was 1.  k(T) was computed from 600 - 2000 K, in 200 K intervals.  An
asymmetric Eckart tunneling correction was used.

The computed k(T) was 1.482e-02 * (T/1K)^4.313 * exp(-8.016 kcal/mol / RT) cm3 mol-1 s-1.
MRH divided the pre-exponential by 2 to account for the reaction path degeneracy.

NOTE: Running PopulateReactions before and after this number produced results that differed by less than a factor
of three.  New numbers in the RMG database thus lead to an improvement in the RMG estimate (RMG works!).  Also,
this computed rate coefficient is a factor of 10 faster than Tsang's recommendation for C3H6 + OOCH3 = HOOCH3 + allyl;
his stated uncertainty is a factor of ten.  However, one would expect abstraction from the secondary carbon of
1-butane to be faster than the primary carbon of propene, because the C-H bond strength should be weaker.  So,
this calculation is in reasonable agreement with the literature.
