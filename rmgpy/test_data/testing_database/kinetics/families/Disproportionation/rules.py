Literature review: i-C3H7 + O2 = HO2 + C3H6

pg. 931-932: Discussion on evaluated data

Entry 42,3 (a): Author appears to be skeptical of the only experimentally reported

value.  Author notes that more recent work on C2H5+O2 suggested that the
addition and disproportionation rxns may be coupled through a common intermediate.
For the time being, the author decided to recommend the only experimentally
reported rate coefficient, only for temperatures above 700K, as they note the
addition rxn should be the predominant rxn at lower temperatures.
MRH 30-Aug-2009

Divide the rate constant by 12 to account for symmetry of 2 (O2) and 6 (i-C3H7, carbons #1 and 3).  The final result is 1.05833e+10 cm3/mol/s.

Literature review.  CH3 + i-C3H7 --> C3H6 + CH4

pg. 937: Discussion on evaluated data

Entry 42,16 (b): Author notes that measurements performed by Arthur and Anastasi on

the rate coefficient of total CH3+i-C3H7 decomposition matches very well with
the coefficient derived from the recommended rate of CH3+CH3 decomposition, the 
recommended rate of i-C3H7+i-C3H7 decomposition, and the geometric rule.  The author
recommends a high-pressure rate expression of 4.7x10^-11*(300/T)^0.68 cm3/molecule/s
for the addition rexn (based on the geometric mean rule???) and recommends the 
branching ratio of 0.16 reported by Gibian and Corley (1973).
NOTE: Previous data entry appeared to compute A and n as such:

A = 0.16 * 4.7x10^-11 * (1/300)^0.68
n = 0.68
However, MRH would compute A and n:

A = 0.16 * 4.7x10^-11 * (300)^0.68
n = -0.68
These are the values that now reside in the database.  The online NIST database

(kinetics.nist.gov) agree with what I have calculated.

pg.251: Discussion on evaluated data

*** UPPER LIMIT ***

Entry 47,3(b): The author states that there is uncertainty whether this rxn is appreciable

at high temperatures.  There were conflicting results published regarding the
significance above 461K (Morgan et al. and Slagle and Gutman).  The author thus
decides to place an upper limit on the rate coefficient of 2x10^-12 * exp(-6820/T)
cm3/molecule/s.  The author further notes that this upper limit assumes no
contribution from a complex rearrangement of the adduct.  Finally, the author
notes that this rxn should not be significant in combustion situations.
MRH 31-Aug-2009

Divide the rate constant by 2 to account for symmetry of 2 (O2) and 1 (allyl, carbon #2). The final result is 6.022e+11 cm3/mol/s, Ea = 13.55 kcal/mol.

based on rxn C3H5+C2H5=C2H4+C3H6 (James, D.G.L. and Troughton, G.E.); this leads to disproportionation-

NOTE: The Ea reported in the discussion is Ea/R=-132 Kelvin.  However, in the table near

the beginning of the review article (summarizing all reported data) and in the NIST
online database (kinetics.nist.gov), the reported Ea/R=-66 Kelvin.  MRH took the
geometric mean of the allyl combination rxn (1.70x10^-11 * exp(132/T)) and methyl
combination rxn (1.68x10^-9 * T^-0.64) to obtain 1.69x10^-11 * T^-0.32 * exp(66/T).

H+CH3CHOH --> H2+CH3CHO

pg.661: Measured rate coefficient mentioned in abstract as k6.

pg.665-666: Discussion on measured rate coefficient.  The reported rate coefficient is

for H+CH3CHOH --> products, making this an UPPER LIMIT.  The rate coefficient
was calculated based on the rate coefficient of the rxn C2H5+H --> CH3+CH3; the
value the authors used was 3.6x10^13 cm3/mol/s.

CH2OH + CH3 --> CH2O + CH4

pg.378 Table 2: Formation and decay rates of CH2OH, CH3, and OH observed by pulse radiolysis of

gas mixtures of varying composition.  Chemical composition of systems A-E as in Table 1.
The authors note below Table 2 that the reported rate coefficient for CH3+CH2OH is an

"adjustment of model to reproduce the observed decay rates of CH3 and CH2OH".
MRH is skeptical of data, as this specific rxn is not directly referenced in the article,

nor do the authors address whether other channels besides -->CH4+CH2O exist / are significant.
The value of A in the database is consistent with that reported in Table 2.

Meier, et al. (1985) measured the rate of addition + disproportionation.  Tsang estimates

a disproportionation to combination ratio of 0.5
NOTE: Rate coefficient given in table at beginning of reference (summarizing all data

presented) gives k_a+b = 2.4x10^-11, leading to k_b = 8x10^-12.  NIST's online
database (kinetics.nist.gov) reports this number as well.  However, the discussion
on pg. 506 suggests k_a+b = 1.5x10^-11, leading to k_b = 5x10^-12.

Estimating rate coefficient for cyclopentadienyl radical + butadieneyl radical
NIST estimate for allyl + iso-butyl is 8E+11 at 1000 K, however in our system the butadieneyl radical is also resonance stabilized
and it will be harder to break the bond to give butadiene + cyclopentadiene. Currently estimate it to be a factor of 5 slower.
