"""
This module contains functions for filtering a list of Molecules representing a single Species,
keeping only the representative structures. Relevant for filtration of negligible mesomerism contributing structures.

The rules this module follows are (by order of importance):

    1. Minimum overall deviation from the Octet Rule (elaborated for Dectet for sulfur as a third row element)
    2. Additional charge separation is only allowed for radicals if it makes a new radical site in the species
    3. If a structure must have charge separation, negative charges will be assigned to more electronegative atoms,
       whereas positive charges will be assigned to less electronegative atoms (charge stabilization)
    4. Opposite charges will be as close as possible to one another, and vice versa (charge stabilization)

        - Both of NO2's resonance structures will be kept: [O]N=O <=> O=[N+.][O-]
        - NCO will only have two resonance structures [N.]=C=O <=> N#C[O.], and will loose the third structure which has
          the same octet deviation, has a charge separation, but the radical site has already been considered: [N+.]#C[O-]
        - CH2NO keeps all three structures, since a new radical site is introduced: [CH2.]N=O <=> C=N[O.] <=> C=[N+.][O-]

    """
    Returns a filtered list of molecules based on heuristics for determining
    representative aromatic resonance structures.

    For monocyclic aromatics, Kekule structures are removed, with the
    assumption that an equivalent aromatic structure exists. Non-aromatic
    structures are maintained if they present new radical sites. Instead of
    explicitly checking the radical sites, we only check for the SDSDSD bond
    motif since radical delocalization will disrupt that pattern.

    For polycyclic aromatics, structures without any benzene bonds are removed.
    The idea is that radical delocalization into the aromatic pi system is
    unfavorable because it disrupts aromaticity. Therefore, structures where
    the radical is delocalized so far into the molecule such that none of the
    rings are aromatic anymore are not representative. While this isn't strictly
    true, it helps reduce the number of representative structures by focusing
    on the most important ones.
