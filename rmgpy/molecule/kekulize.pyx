"""
This module contains functions for kekulization of a aromatic molecule.
The only function that should be used outside of this module is the main
`kekulize()` function. The remaining functions and classes are designed only
to support the kekulization algorithm, and should not be used on their own.

The basic algorithm is as follows:
1. Identify all aromatic rings in the molecule, based on bond types.
2. For each ring, identify endocyclic and exocyclic bonds.
3. Determine if any bonds in the ring are already defined (not benzene bonds).
4. For the remaining bonds, determine whether or not they can be double bonds.
5. If a clear determination cannot be made, make heuristic based assumption.
6. Continue until all bonds in the ring are determined.
7. Continue until all rings in the molecule are determined.

Here, `endo` refers to bonds that comprise a given ring, while `exo` refers to
bonds that are connected to atoms in the ring, but not part of the ring itself.

A key part of the algorithm is use of degree of freedom (DOF) analysis in order
to determine the optimal order to solve the system. Rings and bonds with fewer
DOFs have fewer ways to be to be kekulized, and are generally easier to solve.
Each ring or bond that is fixed reduces the DOF of adjacent rings and bonds,
and the process continues until the entire molecule can be solved.
