"""
This module contains classes and methods for working with statistical mechanics
models for various molecular degrees of freedom. All such models derive from 
the :class:`Mode` base class, and include:

* :class:`Translation` - 3D translational motion in an ideal gas

* :class:`RigidRotor` - 2D (linear) or 3D (nonlinear) external rotational motion, modeled as a rigid rotor

* :class:`HarmonicOscillator` - A set of independent 1D vibrational motions, modeled as harmonic oscillators

* :class:`HinderedRotor` - 1D internal (hindered) torsional rotation using a simple cosine or Fourier series potential

A list of molecular degrees of freedom can be stored in a :class:`StatesModel`
object.
