### Best practices for PRs:

* Rebase to the main branch before working, to avoid merge conflicts.

* Keep PRs small and aim to merge quickly.

* Submit a PR only when the code is polished and ready for review. Consider opening a draft PR for work in progress that requires collaborator input.

* For complex, multi-step PRs, consider opening "megathread" PRs pointing to the main branch. Then, create other PRs that merge into the "megathread" PR branch. This helps divide the review process into smaller chunks.
