This folder contains ipython notebooks containing scripts and other notes related to using RMG.

If you do not have ipython installed, we suggest installing it through the jupyter package while your rmg environment is activated by typing the following commands:

source activate rmg_env
conda install jupyter


For Windows users:

activate rmg_env
conda install jupyter
