         ***high probability of inaccuracy***
         Checked by Greg Magoon; I suspect the parameters in the paper come from a different reaction (maybe H + C2H2 -> products?); (even if it was the correct reaction, the parameters used by NIST and RMG appear to be based off of values from the abstract, but p. 1637 seems to suggest that it may be more complicated, perhaps a collision theory-type form as alluded to in the abstract...p. 1637 states "In calculating E1 allowance was made for the term T^1/2 appearing in the frequency factor.";if this is the case, then the NIST record is inaccurate; almost all the other papers in NIST database report 3rd order rate constant, which is proportional to [M]; the best assessment I have found is Stace and Murrell, IJCK, v. 10, p. 197-212, which seems to suggest bimolecular rate constant of at least ~10^14 at high pressure (over 3 orders of magnitude higher than this value); this paper and Troe, Ann. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1978. 29: 223-250. make reference to "diffusion" limitations at very high pressure; another (relatively minor) consideration is that we will probably want to divide the reported rate coefficient by 2 to correctly account for stoichiometry

         Verified by Greg Magoon; RMG and NIST data seem to be the same; presumably, NIST fit is based off of data in Table 3, but the fit isn't quite right, especially at 1500 K ; using the 700 and 1300 table values, I get Ea=1.03 kcal/mol; using 1300 K value, I get A = 5.66E14 cm^3/mol-s; fit seems to be essentially indistinguishable from data at end points, and error is just under 10% at 1000 K...since the NIST fit has a slightly lower maximum error, I will just leave it the way it is; aside: 10^9.7 prefactor mentioned on p. 637 doesn't seem consistent with NIST data or paper data in Table III; this is presumably high-pressure limit since no pressure-dependence is indicated in the table

            [172]: reported rate coefficient is for k_inf (see Table 1); temperature range considered is 1000-1200 K; this paper cites: Emdee, J. L., Brezinsky, K., and Glassman, I., J. Phys. Chem. 96:2151–2161 (1992) DOI: 10.1021/j100184a025 (included as 172b, above), which, in turn, references [173] (Troe) paper...conditions for this paper are 1100 K - 1200 K
            [173]: this contains the uncertainty estimate (see Table 2); I updated the DA uncertainty as I have done elsewhere; this seems to be the actual raw value that was subsequently interpreted/used in the paper cited by Ref. 172; conditions are 300 K and 1 bar, so apparently, the paper cited by Ref. 172 and/or Ref. 172 itself has assumed that it is in high-pressure limit and that it is temperature independent

         Verified by Greg Magoon; value confirmed from paper data in Table III; this is presumably high-pressure limit since no pressure-dependence is indicated in the table

         Verified by Greg Magoon: the existing k in the rateLibrary appeared to be off by a factor of two, since the paper uses d[HCO]/dt=-k*[HCO]^2; they report k=(5+/-2)*10^-11 molecules^-1*cm^3/s (references 9, 19, and 20 in this paper could have better data); I think in rateLibrary, we should have half of this (2.5 +/- 1), so I have changed the value in the rateLibrary accordingly (with 2nd opinion to confirm from MRH)

	 Curran's estimation based on Tsang's [92] reccomendation for tC4H9 Curran's estimation. About a factor of 2 slower than other 
	 values from literature for smaller alkyl, based upon the consideration that rate constants decrease with the increasing size of R radical.

	 Curran's estimation in DME modeling for ketohydroperoxide decomposition 
         Apparently the number comes from estimate for reverse of Rxn. 337: HO2CH2OCHO -> .OCH2OCHO + .OH (2E13) (p. 234); reverse of Rxn. 191 (p. 238) would also be informative, but it doesn't seem to be disucussed in paper
	 Verified by Greg Magoon; it is not immediately clear whether this rate constant is for high pressure limit, but based on other references to high pressure limit in the paper, I suspect that it is a high pressure limit value
