	 CH2=CHC(=CH2)C(=CH2)CH-CH2 --> cyclobutene, 1,2-diethenyl. (Apparently, reaction of 4->5; doesn't seem to be a birad recombination; note similar reaction in reference 6
	 Data derived from fitting to a complex mechanism. Excitation: thermal, analysis: GC. Pressure 0.01-0.77 atm.
         ***Should probably be removed, as this does not fit with this reaction family*** GRM: I have commented it out for the time-being; the reaction that might actually be relevant here is 2->13 (Abb. 1)
         Verified by Greg Magoon (with translation help from CFG); Barrier, DA, and DE0 changed based on Gl. 8 on p. 1937; I didn't check if this was high-pressure limit

	 CH2=CHCH(.)CH2CH2CH(.)CH=CH2 --> 4-vinylcyclohexene. (Rxn. -c); arises from birad recombination of resonance isomer: .CH2CH=CHCH2CH2CH(.)CH=CH2
	 Data are estimated.
         ***this only considers cis-cis isomer reaction*** cis-trans A prefactor is 50% of the value used here; also, on p. 4923, it is stated that cis trans rate is 5/6 of the overall rate, so maybe the k that should be used is 0.6 of the value currently in place?
         Verified by Greg Magoon: Rxn. -d. also looks to be of interest here; whether the rate is high-pressure limit was not investigated, but p. 4922 says that pressures involved were low; DE0 uncertainty added; regarding temperature range, I considered dropping lower temperature limit from 550 K to 400 K (based on p. 4923), but it seems that experiments were performed at or around 600 K, so I will leave it at 550-650 K
	 Note: after some preliminary confusion on my part, it looks like the existing groups are correct (the correct resonance form for the CH2 radical is taken into account with the Ypri_rad_out (i.e. Cpri_rad_out_H2)), but arguably, another, a more-specific group (C_rad_out_H2/OneDe and Cpri_rad_out_H2/OneDe) should be specified to account for delocalizing group at this site

	 (E)-CH2=CHCH=CHCH=CH2 --> 1,3-cyclohexadiene.
         ***Reference doesn't have this reaction***
	 Absolute value measured directly. Excitation: thermal, analysis: GC.
         Checked by Greg Magoon: this reference doesn't seem to have this reaction, and even if it did, it wouldn't be biradical recombination; therefore, I have commented this entry out; there are some (polycyclic) birad recombinations and ring opening reactions in the paper, however

	 (Z)-CH2=CHCH=CHCH=CH2 --> 1,3-cyclohexadiene.
	 Absolute value measured directly. Excitation: thermal, analysis: Vis-UV. Pressure0.08-0.11 atm.
         ***Should probably be removed, as this does not seem to fit with this reaction family***
         Checked by Greg Magoon: this reference does not seem to consider biradical form; as far as I can tell, they are considering "regular" 1,3,5-hexatriene (not diradical excited state)
