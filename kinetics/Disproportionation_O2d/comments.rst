Literature review: i-C3H7 + O2 = HO2 + C3H6

pg. 931-932: Discussion on evaluated data

Entry 42,3 (a): Author appears to be skeptical of the only experimentally reported

value.  Author notes that more recent work on C2H5+O2 suggested that the
addition and disproportionation rxns may be coupled through a common intermediate.
For the time being, the author decided to recommend the only experimentally
reported rate coefficient, only for temperatures above 700K, as they note the
addition rxn should be the predominant rxn at lower temperatures.

Literature review: n-C3H7 + O2 = HO2 + C3H6

pg. 914-915: Discussion on evaluated data

Entry 41,3 (a): The author suggests a rate coefficient based on those reported in the

literature.  The author notes that the data reported in the literature suggests
the formation of C3H6 is controlled by the addition rxn.  The author further
notes that it is surprising that p-dependence effects are not observed for
C3H6 formation.

Literature review: O2 + iC4H9 --> iC4H8 + HO2

pg. 52-53: Discussion on evaluated data

Entry 45,3 (a): The author recommends a rate coefficient based on the experiments performed

by Baker et al. (yielding a disproportionation-to-decomposition ratio) and the
current (Tsang) study's recommended iC4H9 unimolecular decomposition rate.

Literature review: O2 + C3H5 --> H2C=C=CH2 + HO2

*** UPPER LIMIT ***

Entry 47,3(b): The author states that there is uncertainty whether this rxn is appreciable

at high temperatures.  There were conflicting results published regarding the
significance above 461K (Morgan et al. and Slagle and Gutman).  The author thus
decides to place an upper limit on the rate coefficient of 2x10^-12 * exp(-6820/T)
cm3/molecule/s.  The author further notes that this upper limit assumes no
contribution from a complex rearrangement of the adduct.  Finally, the author
notes that this rxn should not be significant in combustion situations.
