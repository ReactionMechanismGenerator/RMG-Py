This is the main executable script for CanTherm, a tool for computing chemical
reaction rates and other properties used in detailed kinetics models using
various methodologies and theories. To run CanTherm, use the command ::

    $ python cantherm.py FILE

where ``FILE`` is the path to a CanTherm input file describing the job to
execute. CanTherm will run the specified job, writing the output to
``output.py`` and a log to both the console and to ``cantherm.log``, with both
files appearing in the same directory as the input file. Some additional
command-line arguments are available; run the command ::

    $ python cantherm.py -h

for more information.
