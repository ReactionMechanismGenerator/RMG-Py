*********************************
RMG-Py v\ |release| documentation
*********************************

RMG is an automatic chemical reaction mechanism generator 
that constructs kinetic models composed of elementary chemical reaction 
steps using a general understanding of how molecules react.

This documentation is for the newer Python version of RMG that we call RMG-Py.

CanTherm is developend and distributed as part of RMG-Py, but can be used as a stand-alone
application for Thermochemistry, Transition State Theory, and Master Equation chemical kinetics
calculations. Its user guide is also included.

For the latest documentation and full documentation of the API and source code,
