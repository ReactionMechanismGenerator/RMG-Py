License Requirements
====================

RMG is an open source program, available to the general public free of charge. The primary RMG code is distributed under the terms of the `MIT/X11 License <http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php>`_.

Dependencies
============

.. NOTE::
	RMG has been tested on the Python 2.5.x and Python 2.6.x releases; it is unlikely to work with Python 3.0 and higher.


RMG currently depends on the following Python packages:

==========  ==========  =============  =========================================

In addition, you will need a C compiler to build certain RMG modules. These modules will work without this compiling; however, compiling gives you a significant speed increase and is highly recommended.

Our experience with Windows has been that you should use Windows installers for openbabel, numpy, scipy, and matplotlib, and easy_install for the remaining packages. Note that you will need to add certain directories to the PATH environment variable to allow for quick access to various executables on the command line.

On Linux many of these packages are available within your distro's repository. Depending on your distro, however, you may want to use easy_install to get the latest versions of certain packages.

Installation
============

#. **Compile the Cython modules.** A makefile has been provided in the source/ directory for this purpose. In general the procedure is to run Cython on each module to generate the C code, then run the setup.py script with the command::

	$ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

#. **Compile the documentation.** A makefile has been provided in the documentation/ directory for this purpose.

Running RMG
===========

Once RMG is installed you can execute it by running rmg.py and passing it the path to an RMG input file. For example, to run the 1,3-hexadiene example, run::

	$ python rmg.py ../examples/1,3-hexadiene/input.xml

To see a list of the command-line options, run::

	$ python rmg.py -h
