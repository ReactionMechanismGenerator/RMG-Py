RMG is an automatic chemical reaction mechanism generator 
that constructs kinetic models composed of elementary chemical reaction 
steps using a general understanding of how molecules react.

This documentation is for developers of the newer Python version of RMG that we call RMG-Py.
It includes the full API. For instructions on how to use RMG, please refer to the User Guide.
