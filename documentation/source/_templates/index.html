  <h1>Reaction Mechanism Generator Documentation</h1>

  <p style="margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 12px">
    <strong>Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG)</strong> is an automatic chemical reaction mechanism generator 
    that constructs kinetic models composed of elementary chemical reaction 
    steps using a general understanding of how molecules react.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    These pages describe the newer Python version of RMG that we call RMG-Py.
    It is developed on github as <a href="https://github.com/ReactionMechanismGenerator/RMG-Py/" title="RMG-Java github project">RMG-Py</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>CanTherm</strong> is developed and distributed as part of RMG-Py, but can be used as a stand-alone
    application for Thermochemistry, Transition State Theory, and Master Equation chemical kinetics
    calculations.
  </p>
  
RMG is free, open-source software, and is under active and ongoing development. 
If you are interested in assisting with or guiding its development, please let us know. Any issues,
concerns, or comments can be posted to our <a href="http://www.github.com/ReactionMechanismGenerator/RMG-Py/issues">Github issues page</a>.
While you are free to use/modify RMG components as you wish, we would like to 
co-ordinate with you. Please contact <a href="mailto:whgreen@mit.edu">Professor William H. Green</a>,
<a href="mailto:r.west@neu.edu">Professor Richard H. West</a>,
or the <a href="mailto:rmg_dev@mit.edu">The RMG Development Team</a> for further information.
