Example Input Files

Ethane pyrolysis (Minimal)
==========================

This is the minimal example file characterizing a very basic system for ethane pyrolysis and should run quickly if RMG is set up properly. It does not include any 
calculation of pressure-dependent reaction rates.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../examples/rmg/minimal/input.py


1,3-hexadiene pyrolysis
=======================

This example models the pyrolysis of 1,3-hexadiene and demonstrates the effect of turning on the pressure-dependence module within RMG.
