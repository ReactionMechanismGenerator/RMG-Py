****************************************************************************
Binary Installation Using Anaconda for Unix-Based Systems: Linux and Mac OSX
****************************************************************************


#. Install the `conda` package manager, if you do not already have it (or Anaconda).
   Select one of the following options:

   a. Users of Fedora Linux and Red Hat derivatives (RHEL, CentOS Stream) may install from the official repositories and EPEL, respectively, with the command ::

       sudo dnf install conda

   b. All other users, download and install `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_.

      The download will be a .sh file with a name like ``Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh``.
      Open a terminal in the same directory as this file, and type the following to install Conda
      (replace the name of your .sh file below). ::

       bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

      **When prompted to append Anaconda to your PATH, select or type Yes**. 
      Install the Conda folder inside your home directory 
      (typically ``/home/YourUsername/`` in Linux and ``/Users/YourUsername`` in Mac).

      Note that you should reinitialize or restart your terminal in order for the changes to take effect, as the installer will tell you.

#. Install both RMG and the RMG-database binaries through the terminal.   Dependencies will be installed automatically. It is safest to make a new conda environment for RMG and its dependencies. Type the following command into the terminal to create the new environment named 'rmg_env' containing the latest stable version of the RMG program and its database. ::

    conda create -c defaults -c rmg -c rdkit -c cantera -c pytorch -c conda-forge --name rmg_env rmg rmgdatabase

   Whenever you wish to use it you must first activate the environment::

    conda activate rmg_env

#. You may now run an RMG test job. Save the `Minimal Example Input File <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReactionMechanismGenerator/RMG-Py/master/examples/rmg/minimal/input.py>`_
   to a local directory.  Use the terminal to run your RMG job inside that folder using the following command ::

    rmg.py input.py

   If you encounter the ImportError related to ``libmkl_rt.so.2``, refer to the :ref:`Fixing the ImportError related to libmkl_rt.so.2 <fixImportError>`
   section below to fix the error and re-run the RMG test job.

You may now use RMG-Py, Arkane, as well as any of the :ref:`Standalone Modules <modules>` included in the RMG-Py package.

Fixing the ImportError related to ``libmkl_rt.so.2``
============================================================

You may encounter the following ImportError when you try to run a RMG test job ::

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/PATH-TO-YOUR-ANACONDA/envs/rmg_env/bin/rmg.py", line 48, in <module>
        from rmgpy.rmg.main import RMG, initialize_log, process_profile_stats, make_profile_graph
      File "/PATH-TO-YOUR-ANACONDA/envs/rmg_env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/rmgpy/rmg/main.py", line 51, in <module>
        from cantera import ck2cti
      File "/PATH-TO-YOUR-ANACONDA/envs/rmg_env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/cantera/__init__.py", line 4, in <module>
        from ._cantera import *
    ImportError: libmkl_rt.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

where ``PATH-TO-YOUR-ANACONDA`` is the path to the ``Anaconda3`` directory installed on your machine.
The default install location of Anaconda on Linux is ``/home/<your_username>/Anaconda3``.

To fix this issue, simply copy ``libmkl_rt.so.1`` as ``libmkl_rt.so.2`` under the rmg environment library by typing the following
line on your terminal::

    cp /PATH-TO-YOUR-ANACONDA/envs/rmg_env/lib/libmkl_rt.so.1 /PATH-TO-YOUR-ANACONDA/envs/rmg_env/lib/libmkl_rt.so.2

Note that ``PATH-TO-YOUR-ANACONDA`` needs to be the path to your ``Anaconda3`` directory, which mostly likely looks
like ``/home/<your_username>/Anaconda3``. If you are unable to locate the ``libmkl_rt.so.1`` file on your computer, you can find its location with the following command::

    locate libmkl_rt.so.1

After copying the file as ``libmkl_rt.so.2``, try running the RMG test job again::

    rmg.py input.py

You will see a line saying ``MODEL GENERATION COMPLETED`` on your terminal if your RMG test job ran successfully.


Updating your binary installation of RMG in Linux or Mac OSX
============================================================

If you had previously installed a binary version of the RMG package, you may
check and update your installation to the latest stable version available on Anaconda by typing the following command on the terminal ::

    source activate rmg_env
    conda update rmg rmgdatabase -c rmg
