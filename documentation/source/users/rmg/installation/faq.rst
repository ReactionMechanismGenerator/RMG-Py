* Got an error of ``Segmentation fault:11`` after installing RMG on my machine?

	**Segmentation fault** is a typical error in C code, caused by a program trying to read or write an illegal memory location, i.e. one it is not allowed to access. The most common cause in RMG is a conflict between two different versions of a shared library.  RMG has some dependencies which are written in C++, e.g. rdkit, openbabel. If you compile one of these with a different version of some compiler library, or you compile RMG using one version and run it with another, you will often get a Segmentation fault. Chances are those packages are not up to date, or maybe your environmental variable ``PATH`` is messed up so that the wrong version of something is being found. Please see one example from a user having same `Segmentation fault issue <https://github.com/ReactionMechanismGenerator/RMG-website/issues/125>`_.

* How can I install RMG-Py without Anaconda?

	Usually we don't recommend installing RMG-Py without Anaconda because it takes longer and is easier to get trouble with package management. But one still can try direct installation on Linux or MacOS by following :ref:`Linux instruction<linux>` or :ref:`MacOS instruction<macos>`. The RMG team does not use this install approach internally any more, so these instructions are not actively maintained.

* Windows binary installation gives ``WindowsError: [Error 5]``?
	
	Error 5 is access is denied, so this is either a permissions error, or an issue with the Windows file lock. `These posts <https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/708>`_ suggest rebooting the computer (in case it's a file lock), and running the anaconda prompt, from which you run ``conda create -c rmg --name rmg_env rmg rmgdatabase``, as an administrator (in case it's a permissions error). Please checkout one example from a user having `Windows binary installation issue <https://github.com/ReactionMechanismGenerator/RMG-Py/issues/779>`_.
	

If you have any other errors please report them by opening an `issue <https://github.com/ReactionMechanismGenerator/RMG-Py/issues?q=is%3Aissue>`_, and for general questions ask in the `RMG-Py chat room <https://gitter.im/ReactionMechanismGenerator/RMG-Py>`_.
