Analyzing the Output Files
**************************

You will see that a sucessfully executed RMG job will create multiple output files and folders: 
``output.html``
``/chemkin``
``/pdep``  
``/plot``
``/solver``
``/species``  
``restart.pkl``  
``RMG.log``

------------------
The Chemkin Folder
------------------ 
The ``/chemkin`` folder will likely have a large number of chemkin formatted files. In general, these can be disregarded, as you will be mainly interested in ``chem.inp``, the chemkin formatted input file with a species list, thermochemical database, and a list of elementary reactions. All of inp files appended with numbers are those that have been generated by RMG as it runs and the mechanism is still in progress of enlarging. ``chem_annotated.inp`` is provided as a means to help make sense of species syntax and information sources (i.e., how RMG estimated indivual kinetic and thermodynmic parameters). In addition, a species dictionary, ``species_dictionary.txt``, is generated containing all the species in your mechanism in the format of an adjacency list. Either chemkin file, in addition to the dictionary, may be used as inputs in the `tools <http://rmg.mit.edu/simulate/>`_ section of this website to better `visualize <http://rmg.mit.edu/simulate/chemkin>`_ the species and reactions. Alternatively, you can open ``output.html``, and if the input option ``drawMolecules=`` is set to True, you will be able to visualize 2D images of all species and reactions in your mechanism. Once you are able to visualize the mechanism, several useful tools exist. For example, in the `Reaction Details` section, you'll see the following with check-box fields beside them:

	* Kinetics
	* Comments
	* Chemkin strings 

If you check the last box, chemkin strings, you can then search for strings corresponding to seemingly nonsensical named species (e.g. S(1234)) that may show up in any analyses/simulations you perform (e.g., with Cantera or Chemkin). Further, under `Reaction Ramilies`, you can selectively view the reactions that been generated based on a particular RMG reaction family or library. 

------------------
The Species Folder
------------------ 
If ``drawMolecules=True`` is specified as an RMG input `option`, the species folder will be populated with png files with 2D pictures of each species in your final mechanism. Otherwise, it will contain no files, or files generated from pressure dependent jobs. 

------------------
The Pdep Folder
------------------ 
The ``/pdep`` folder will contain files associated with the pressure-dependent reactions that RMG has generated, if you requested such a job. These files are formatted as input files for `CanTherm <http://greengroup.github.io/RMG-Py/users/cantherm/index.html>`_, which can be run independently. This can be useful if one wants to visualize the potential energy surface corresponding to any particular network. 

------------------
The Solver Folder
------------------ 
RMG currently includes a solver for isothermal batch reactors. This is in fact a critical part of the model enlargement algorithm. If you have included simulations in your input file, the solutions will be located in ``/solver``. You will probably only be interested in the files with the largest number tags.
