.. _generateChemkinHTML:

*******************
HTML Chemkin Output
*******************

The script, ``generateChemkinHTML.py``, will create a formatted HTML page displaying
all of the species and reactions in a given Chemkin file. Thermo and kinetics parameters
are also displayed, along with any comments if the Chemkin file was generated by RMG.

This script gives the same output as turning on ``generateOutputHTML`` in the :ref:`options <miscellaneousoptions>`
section of the RMG input file. However, having using that setting can increase the
memory usage and computation time for large jobs, so this script provides an option
for generating the HTML file after job completion.

To use this script, you need a Chemkin input file and an RMG species dictionary.
The syntax is as follows::

    python generateChemkinHTML.py [-h, -f] CHEMKIN DICTIONARY [OUTPUT]

Positional arguments::

    CHEMKIN        The path to the Chemkin file
    DICTIONARY     The path to the RMG dictionary file
    OUTPUT         Location to save the output files, defaults to the current directory

Optional arguments::

    -h, --help     Show help message and exit
    -f, --foreign  Not an RMG generated Chemkin file


This method is also available to use with a web browser from the RMG website: `Convert Chemkin File <https://rmg.mit.edu/tools/chemkin>`_.
