Installing Arkane
=================

Arkane can be obtained by installing the `RMG-Py <https://rmg.mit.edu/>`_ software, which
includes all neccesary dependencies.

Instructions to install RMG-Py can be found at the :ref:`RMG-Py Installation page <installation>`.

Note that you'll need to choose between the Basic User or Developer installation instructions
that are specific to your operating system. Modifying Arkane source code will
require Developer installation. If you are only looking to run the code, the
Basic User installation will work.
