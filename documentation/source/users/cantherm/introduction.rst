Introduction

**CanTherm** is a tool for computing the thermodynamic properties of chemical
species and high-pressure-limit rate coefficients for chemical reactions using
the results of a quantum chemistry calculation. Thermodynamic properties are
computed using the rigid rotor-harmonic oscillator approximation with optional
corrections for hindered internal rotors. Kinetic parameters are computed using
canonical transition state theory with optional tunneling correction.

CanTherm can also estimate 
pressure-dependent phenomenological rate coefficients :math:`k(T,P)` for  
unimolecular reaction networks of arbitrary complexity. The approach is to
first generate a detailed model of the reaction network using the 
one-dimensional master equation, then apply one of several available model 
reduction methods of varying accuracy, speed, and robustness to simplify the 
detailed model into a set of phenomenological rate coefficients. The result 
is a set of :math:`k(T,P)` functions suitable for use in chemical reaction
mechanisms. More information is available at `Allen et al. <http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cp22765c>`_.

CanTherm is developed and distributed as part of `RMG-Py <http://rmg.mit.edu/>`_, but can be used as a stand-alone
application for Thermochemistry, Transition State Theory, and Master Equation chemical kinetics calculations. 

CanTherm is written in the `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ programming
language to facilitate ease of development, installation, and use.

Additional theoretical background can be found at `RMG's Theory Guide <http://reactionmechanismgenerator.github.io/RMG-Py/theory/index.html>`_
and `CanTherm's Manual <manual.pdf>`_ as well as the `manual's supplement information <manual_supplement-Solving1DSchrodingerEquation.pdf>`_.
