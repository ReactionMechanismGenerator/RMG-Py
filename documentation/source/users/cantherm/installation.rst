Installing CanTherm
===================

CanTherm can be obtained by installing the `RMG-Py <http://rmg.mit.edu/>`_ software, which
includes all neccesary dependancies.

Instructions to install RMG-Py can be found at the :ref:`RMG-Py Installation page <installation>`.

Note that you'll need to choose between the Basic User or Developer installation instructions
that are specific to your operating system. Modifying cantherm source code will 
require Developer installation. If you are only looking to run the code, the 
Basic User installation will work.
