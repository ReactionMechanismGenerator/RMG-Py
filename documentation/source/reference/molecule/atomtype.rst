The atom type of an atom describes the atom itself and (often) something about
the local bond structure around that atom. This is a useful semantic tool for
accelerating graph isomorphism queries, and a useful shorthand when specifying
molecular substructure patterns via an RMG-style adjacency list.

We define the following basic atom types:
