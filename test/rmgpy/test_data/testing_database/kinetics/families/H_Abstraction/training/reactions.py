Geometries and energies of reactants, products, and TS were computed using the CBS-QB3 methodology; frequencies
were calculated at B3LYP/CBSB7.  Arrhenius expression was computed using CanTherm; an asymmetric Eckart tunneling
correction was employed and the frequencies were scaled by 0.99 (as suggested by Montgomergy et al.; J. Chem. Phys.
110 (1999) 2822-2827).  The Arrhenius fit was based on k(T) at T=600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800, and 2000K.
The external symmetry number for CH2O and iso-butene was 2; the external symmetry for all others was 1.  The
electronic spin multiplicity was 1 for CH2O and iso-butene; the electronic spin multiplicity for all others was 2.

There are no rate coefficients for this reaction in the literature (based on MRH's limited search).
   Tsang {J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 20 (1991) 221-273} recommends the following for the reaction of
   CH2O + H2C=CH-*CH2 = HCO + H2C=CH-CH3: k(T) = 1.26e+08 * T^1.9 * exp(-18.184 kcal/mol / RT) cm3 mol-1 s-1.
   This rate coefficient is 25-85x faster than MRH's calculation over the range 600-2000K.

   The previous estimate by RMG for this reaction was: k(T) = 5.500e+03 * T^2.81 * exp(-5.86 kcal/mol / RT) cm3 mol-1 s-1.
   This rate coefficient is 80-13,000x faster than MRH's calculation over the range 600-2000K.

MRH CBS-QB3 calculations w/1d hindered rotor corrections
Exact reaction: CH3CH2CH=CH2 + OOCH3 = HOOCH3 + CH3CHCH=CH2

This reaction was of interest to MRH/MHS because the butanol model was sensitive to its kinetics
(in particular, the C4H8-1 predicted concentration for 10-atm JSR simulations between 800-1000 K).
The original mechanism had an estimate that was much faster than these new calculations (the RMG old
k(T) was 50-100x faster than these calculations between 800-1000 K).

MRH computed these kinetics using the CBS-QB3 method.  Hindered rotor corrections were accounted for in all species:
    CH3CH2CH=CH2: -CH3 and -CH2CH3 rotor
    OOCH3: -CH3 rotor
    TS: -CH3 and -CH=CH2 rotor of react1, -CH3 and -OCH3 of react2, and -OOCH3 between react1 and react2
    HOOCH3: -CH3 and -OCH3 rotor
    CH3CHCH=CH2: -CH3 and -CH=CH2 rotor
External symmetry number of all speces was 1.  k(T) was computed from 600 - 2000 K, in 200 K intervals.  An
asymmetric Eckart tunneling correction was used.

The computed k(T) was 1.482e-02 * (T/1K)^4.313 * exp(-8.016 kcal/mol / RT) cm3 mol-1 s-1.

NOTE: Running PopulateReactions before and after this number produced results that differed by less than a factor
of three.  New numbers in the RMG database thus lead to an improvement in the RMG estimate (RMG works!).  Also,
this computed rate coefficient is a factor of 10 faster than Tsang's recommendation for C3H6 + OOCH3 = HOOCH3 + allyl;
his stated uncertainty is a factor of ten.  However, one would expect abstraction from the secondary carbon of
1-butane to be faster than the primary carbon of propene, because the C-H bond strength should be weaker.  So,
this calculation is in reasonable agreement with the literature.

The rate of O + C3H6 --> OH + H2C=CH-*CH2 is computed using the expression:
[k(O+C2H6-->C2H5+HO)/k(OH+C2H6-->C2H5+H2O)] * k(OH+C3H6-->H2C=CH-*CH2+H2O).
The author uses this expression because he notes that OH and O H-atom abstraction
rxns generally follow the same trend.  The O+C2H6, OH+C2H6, and OH+C3H6
are from other Tsang review articles.
The rate of O+C3H6 --> OH+CH3C=CH2 is computed by adjusting the O+C3H6 --> OH+H2C=CH-*CH2
rate coefficient: increasing the Ea/R by 880 Kelvin and multiplying the A
by ~0.345; these values come from the relative difference between the rxns

H2O2 + *CH2CH2CH2CH2OH = nButanol + HO2

CBS-QB3 method was used to calculate electronic energy of reactants, products, and TS; frequencies were
calculated using B3LYP/CBSB7 method.  Arrhenius expression was computed using CanTherm: an asymmetric Eckart
tunneling correction was employed and the frequencies were scaled by 0.99 (as suggested by Montgomery et al.

CH2O + H2C=C[*CH2][CH3] = HCO + H2C=C[CH3]2

Geometries and energies of reactants, products, and TS were computed using the CBS-QB3 methodology; frequencies
were calculated at B3LYP/CBSB7.  Arrhenius expression was computed using CanTherm; an asymmetric Eckart tunneling
correction was employed and the frequencies were scaled by 0.99 (as suggested by Montgomergy et al.; J. Chem. Phys.
110 (1999) 2822-2827).  The Arrhenius fit was based on k(T) at T=600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800, and 2000K.
The external symmetry number for CH2O and iso-butene was 2; the external symmetry for all others was 1.  The
electronic spin multiplicity was 1 for CH2O and iso-butene; the electronic spin multiplicity for all others was 2.
The computed pre-exponential factor was divided by 2 (symmetry of CH2O), from 6.13e-02 to 3.065e-02.

There are no rate coefficients for this reaction in the literature (based on MRH's limited search).
   Tsang {J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 20 (1991) 221-273} recommends the following for the reaction of
   CH2O + H2C=CH-*CH2 = HCO + H2C=CH-CH3: k(T) = 1.26e+08 * T^1.9 * exp(-18.184 kcal/mol / RT) cm3 mol-1 s-1.
   This rate coefficient is 25-85x faster than MRH's calculation over the range 600-2000K.

   The previous estimate by RMG for this reaction was: k(T) = 5.500e+03 * T^2.81 * exp(-5.86 kcal/mol / RT) cm3 mol-1 s-1.
   This rate coefficient is 80-13,000x faster than MRH's calculation over the range 600-2000K.

It was measured at pretty low temperatures (294-376), but also calculated ab initio. The calculated
rates are plotted but the expression is not reported.

    k = (10.0 +- 2.1)E-11 exp[-(4.4+-0.5 kJ mol)/RT] cm3 molecule-1 s-1

MRH CBS-QB3 calculations w/1d hindered rotor corrections
Exact reaction: CH3CH2CH=CH2 + OOCH3 = HOOCH3 + CH3CHCH=CH2

This reaction was of interest to MRH/MHS because the butanol model was sensitive to its kinetics
(in particular, the C4H8-1 predicted concentration for 10-atm JSR simulations between 800-1000 K).
The original mechanism had an estimate that was much faster than these new calculations (the RMG old
k(T) was 50-100x faster than these calculations between 800-1000 K).

MRH computed these kinetics using the CBS-QB3 method.  Hindered rotor corrections were accounted for in all species:
	CH3CH2CH=CH2: -CH3 and -CH2CH3 rotor
	OOCH3: -CH3 rotor
	TS: -CH3 and -CH=CH2 rotor of react1, -CH3 and -OCH3 of react2, and -OOCH3 between react1 and react2
	HOOCH3: -CH3 and -OCH3 rotor
	CH3CHCH=CH2: -CH3 and -CH=CH2 rotor
External symmetry number of all speces was 1.  k(T) was computed from 600 - 2000 K, in 200 K intervals.  An
asymmetric Eckart tunneling correction was used.

The computed k(T) was 1.482e-02 * (T/1K)^4.313 * exp(-8.016 kcal/mol / RT) cm3 mol-1 s-1.
MRH divided the pre-exponential by 2 to account for the reaction path degeneracy.

NOTE: Running PopulateReactions before and after this number produced results that differed by less than a factor
of three.  New numbers in the RMG database thus lead to an improvement in the RMG estimate (RMG works!).  Also,
this computed rate coefficient is a factor of 10 faster than Tsang's recommendation for C3H6 + OOCH3 = HOOCH3 + allyl;
his stated uncertainty is a factor of ten.  However, one would expect abstraction from the secondary carbon of
1-butane to be faster than the primary carbon of propene, because the C-H bond strength should be weaker.  So,
this calculation is in reasonable agreement with the literature.

pg 1050, Table 4, Section: HO + HOH = HOH + OH(1), Column k_ab_CVT/SCT

MRH computed modified Arrhenius parameters using least-squares regression: ln(k) = ln(A) + n*ln(T) - (E/R)*(1/T)

E: Multiplied (E/R) expression by 1.987e-3

A: exp(ln(A)), multiplied by 6.02e23 (to convert /molecule to /mol) and divided by 2 (to get rate per H atom)
