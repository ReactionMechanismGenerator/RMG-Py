This folder ('external') is for external programs that RMG depends on but are 
not part of the RMG code itself. In most cases you can get them elsewhere. 
Nevertheless, they are stored here because
 (1) they may be hard to find elsewhere
 (2) we know that that these versions work (but ones from elsewhere may not)
