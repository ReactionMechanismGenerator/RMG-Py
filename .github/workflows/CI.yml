# CI.yml
# This file contains the script used by GitHub actions to execute the Constant Integration (CI)
# for RMG-Py. This includes building RMG and its dependencies, executing the unit tests,
# functional tests, database tests, and regression tests.
# 
# This will run automatically on any push to any branch, but will only run one instance of
# itself at a time per branch (to avoid spawning tons of runners, which prevents them from
# executing).
#
# In the regression testing section of the action the term "Stable" or "Reference" refers to
# the 'correct answers' to the regression tests, i.e. the way that the main branch executes
# them. These 'answers' are re-generated daily, or on any push to main, and retrieved whenever
# a push is made to a non-main branch. The new proposed changes are referred to as "Dynamic".
#
# Changelog:
# April 2023 - Jackson Burns - Added this header, regression tests, cleanup of action in 
# in general, and documentation throughout the file.
#
# May 2023 - added Docker build steps
#
# May 12 2023 - added changes to allow running on forks
