# CI.yml
# This file contains the script used by GitHub actions to execute the Continuous Integration (CI)
# for RMG-Py. This includes building RMG and its dependencies, executing the unit tests,
# functional tests, database tests, and regression tests.
# 
# This will run automatically on any push to any branch, but will only run one instance of
# itself at a time per branch (to avoid spawning tons of runners, which prevents them from
# executing).
#
# In the regression testing section of the action the term "Stable" or "Reference" refers to
# the 'correct answers' to the regression tests, i.e. the way that the main branch executes
# them. These 'answers' are re-generated daily, or on any push to main, and retrieved whenever
# a push is made to a non-main branch. The new proposed changes are referred to as "Dynamic".
#
# The `workflow_call` section below allows running this exact file from RMG-database, saving
# us from having to maintain two copies of it. The only liens needed to facilitate that are
# the `workflow_call` block in the `on` section and the passed `rmg-db-branch` so that we can
# pull appropriately for RMG-database.
#
# Changelog:
# 2023-04    - Jackson Burns - Added this header, regression tests, cleanup of action in 
#              in general, and documentation throughout the file.
# 2023-05    - added Docker build steps
# 2023-05-12 - added changes to allow running on forks
# 2023-06-06 - added matrix build for libstdcxx-ng versions 12 and 13 on ubuntu. Only expect 12 to work.
# 2023-06-07 - updated regression testing. Now fails if significant changes are detected.
# 2023-06-15 - revert changes from 06-06, both now work
# 2023-06-27 - add option to run from RMG-database with GitHub resuable workflows
# 2023-07-17 - made it pass by default
# 2023-07-21 - upload the regression results summary as artifact (for use as a comment on PRs)
