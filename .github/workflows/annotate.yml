name: Annotate pull request with regression summaries
# Takes a regression summary from a workflow run and annotates the pull request with it
# The pull request number is taken from the first line of the summary.txt file.
# The summary file is in an artifact called regression_summary associated
# with the workflow run that triggered this workflow.
# based on https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#using-data-from-the-triggering-workflow
