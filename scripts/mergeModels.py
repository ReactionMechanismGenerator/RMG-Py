"""
This script enables the automatic merging of two or more Chemkin files (and
associated species dictionaries) into a single unified Chemkin file. Simply
pass the paths of the Chemkin files and species dictionaries on the 
command-line, e.g.

    $ python mergeModels.py --model1 /path/to/chem1.inp /path/to/species_dictionary1.txt --model2 /path/to/chem2.inp /path/to/species_dictionary2.txt

The resulting merged files are placed in ``chem.inp`` and
``species_dictionary.txt`` in the execution directory.
